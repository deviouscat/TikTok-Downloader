# TikTok No-Watermark Downloader

This is a small Python script that downloads TikTok videos without a watermark.  
It only asks for a link and saves the video into a folder called **Tiktoks**.

## How it works

You run the script, paste a TikTok link, and it pulls the a no-watermark version using a public endpoint. The file is saved as an mp4 with a simple name.

## Requirements

- Python 3 
- `requests` library ( pip install requests )

Install it with: python tiktok.py

Paste a link when it asks you, and the video will appear in the **Tiktoks** folder.

## Notes

This is for personal use, testing, and learning. It doesn’t use any private APIs and doesn’t require a login.
